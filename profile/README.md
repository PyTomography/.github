# PyTomography

This is the organization page for the main PyTomography repository and all associated libraries. The PyTomography project is an open source initiative that aims to provide tomographic reconstruction algorithms for use on Monte Carlo and clinical medical imaging data. The project began development thanks to the funding, support, and resources of the [Qurit Lab](https://www.bccrc.ca/dept/io-programs/qurit/), and it has since received contributions from other research groups.

* Please cite the [PyTomography paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01977) if you use the software/library in your research.
* The SPECT reconstruction capabilities of the library are built using GPU capable operations from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* The PET and CT reconstruction capabilities of the library are developed using projectors from the [parallelproj library](https://github.com/gschramm/parallelproj)
